        <h1>The Armor Of God</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="content">
        <p>   Paul writes in Ephesians 6:10-13,</p>
        <p>"Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might. Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places. Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand."</p>
		<p>   Paul wrote in verse ten, “Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might.” In this verse, it says that we need to be strong in the Lord. We need to be strong in Him because we are weak, but he is strong. Ephesians 3:20 states it as,</p>
		<p>"Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,"</p>
        <p>   The thing that stands out to me the very most in that verse is when it says, “According to the power that works in us.” It is a similar thought in Ephesians when Paul writes, “Be strong in the Lord.” From that verse, we get that God works through us. And we have to have God on our side because we are weak and he is strong. With God on our side, no one can stand against us. Romans 8:31 says,</p>
        <p>"What, then, shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?"</p>
		<p>   Paul wrote in the next verse, verse eleven, “Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.” First of all, what are wiles? A wile is ‘a deceitful or cunning scheme put in place to manipulate or to convince someone to do what one wants.’ 1 Peter 5:8 states,</p>
		<p>"Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour."</p>
		<p>   So after we have God on our side, because if God was not on our side, there wouldn’t be much use in doing anything, we are supposed to put on the armor of God. The reason why, is so we can resist and stand against the wiles of the devil. As James 4:7 says,</p>
		<p>   Therefore submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.</p>
		<p>   Paul continues on to verse twelve to say, “For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.” We are not fighting a physical battle, we are fighting a spiritual one. The principalities, powers, and rules of the darkness of this age mentioned In this verse are all meaning the devil and his angels. So we are not fighting a physical fight but a spiritual one against the devil and his angels. 2 Corinthians 10:4 says,</p>
		<p>"For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds,"</p>
		<p>   And as was read in Monday's lesson on David and Goliath, 1 Samuel 17:47 states,</p>
		<p>"Then all this assembly shall know that the Lord does not save with sword and spear; for the battle is the Lord’s, and He will give you into our hands."</p>
		<p>   From those two verses we learn that not only is the battle a spiritual one but our weapons are spiritual also. In the first verse it says, “not carnal (of the flesh) but mighty in God'' and in the second verse it says, “For the battle is the Lord’s” God is mighty and he has already won this battle, because the battle belongs to the Lord.</p>
		<p>   Paul writes in verse thirteen, “Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.” Now we have God on our side, we have our armor on, now this verse tells us, having done it all, to stand. As 1 Corinthians 16:13 states,</p>
		<p>"Watch, stand fast in the faith, be brave, be strong."</p>
		<p>   We are to stand, but as this verse says, we are to stand firm, be brave, and be strong. In 2 Timothy 4:7 Paul writes,</p>
		<p>"I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith."</p>
		<p>   Paul wrote this the very year of his death in the last known epistle that he wrote. He said he has fought the good fight. The devil still believes he can win, but he can’t. God has already won this war, because the battle belongs to the Lord.</p>
